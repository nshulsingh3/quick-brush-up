### Built with

### What I learned

By default body tag has some border present.

It is different for different browsers.

This issue got highlighted when I noticed a scroll bar coming after giving 100vh height to the parent div.

### Useful resources

- [Vertical scroll bar on 100vh](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44645465/when-using-height-100vh-for-the-container-vertical-scrollbar-appears) - This helped me for eliminating the scroll bar on my page.
